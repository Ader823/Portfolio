    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>I started with the circle blast project and changed that around to build my game. I did this because I would probably have just kept looking at the project anyway, so I thought it would be easier to start from it. That being said, there isn't a lot of code from the original project left.</p>

    <p>The first half of the project was making the gameplay. The thing that took the most time and itterations was spawning the obstacles. This is because it took a long time to have it be fair and fun. The biggest issue was making sure that there were no scenarios that would be impossible for the player to survive. One way I did this was by making sure obstacles can't spawn right at the beginning of the ground section. Another thing I did was make sure that the shootable walls didn't spawn after short gaps, because sometimes if the shootable part was too high, it was impossible to reach it after a short jump.</p>

    <p>The second half was all about art. The first thing I did was make the run cycle for the player. When that was done, I moved on to the backgrounds and adding parrallax. And then finally, I updated the sprites for the walls and the ground. That part also took a while, specifically the parts of the wall that were shootable. I went through a lot of itterations to see what looked good, and whether it was sdistinct and easy enough to spot out.</p>

    <p>After that, I did touchups for the game. For example, I added a better start and game over screen. Also, because it's possible to make the long gaps with a short jump, I made it so you get rewarded an extra 5 points if you do that. It's risky to do, but a great way to get a lot of points quickly. Typically, I won't go for them after I reach the second level because of how risky they are.</p>

    <p>Finally, I added a sound track, which I made in garage band and with a midi keyboard.</p>
